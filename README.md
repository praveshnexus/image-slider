# image-slider

For this project, our aim is to construct an image slider with a diverse range of functionalities. 
The final product is an image slider that will automatically shift every five seconds.
In addition to this, there will be two buttons, a previous and a next button, enabling users to navigate through the images manually. 
The slider is visually appealing, featuring a stunning box shadow and icons sourced from Font Awesome.
Our approach to creating this project will involve initially building the HTML structure, followed by styling the slider with CSS, and finally, adding functionality to the project using JavaScript.
In essence,this project will teach us how to create an image slider from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including navigation buttons,
automatic image transitioning, and the incorporation of attractive design elements.
